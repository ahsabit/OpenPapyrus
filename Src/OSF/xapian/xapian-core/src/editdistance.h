/** Calculate edit distances to a target string.
 *
 *  Edit distance is defined as the minimum number of edit operations
 *  required to move from one sequence to another.  The edit operations
 *  considered are:
 *   - Insertion of a character at an arbitrary position.
 *   - Deletion of a character at an arbitrary position.
 *   - Substitution of a character at an arbitrary position.
 *   - Transposition of two neighbouring characters at an arbitrary position
 *     in the string.

	 *  typically 64 bits and seems to work pretty well (it makes sense it
	 *  does for English, as each letter maps to a different bit).
	 *
	 *  At least on x86-64 and English, a 32-bit type seems to give an
	 *  identical cycle count to a 64-bit type when profiled with cachegrind,
	 *  but a 64-bit type is likely to work better for languages which have
	 *  more than 32 commonly-used word characters.
	 *
	 *  FIXME: Profile other architectures and languages.
